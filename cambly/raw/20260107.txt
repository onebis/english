We can forget about. Year that has just finished and look to the future. And according to a global survey, many people think 2026 could be better than 2025. Survey company, if I peeps SOS, I post.

McKのアバター

Nealのアバター

Okay. As people from 30 different countries about the year they've just had. What? Was 2025 good? Bad was somewhere in Peru. IPPOS also asked people what they think 2026 will be like. 60% of the people around the world said 66%. 66% of the people around the world said that 2025 was a bad year for their country, but 71% of people believe that 2026 will be better.

The people of Japan are pretty pessimistic too. Only 44% that 2026 will be better year. Only 44% think that 2026 will be better, will be a better year. However, they are a little more positive than they were when I asked them the same question at the end of 2024. So maybe 2026 has some surprises in store. Surprises in store? Surprises in store.

McKのアバター

Especially.

Nealのアバター

In a new season. Yeah. Right? Yep. Would you say you've become more optimistic or more pessimistic over the years? Would you say you become more... Would you say I can't fully understand this question? Would you say you become more optimistic? I'll change it. Okay. Over the years, have you become more.

McKのアバター

Optimistic or more pessimistic when it comes to your mindset? Yeah, maybe optimistic, but. It's not change. But you told me previously that you used to be pessimistic. You're naturally pessimistic. Right? And so you changed that. So I think you become more optimistic, right? Not more. Not change. Really? Maybe I can't understand. This.

Nealのアバター

Question. But yeah, you said I tried to be, I am originally pessimistic, naturally pessimistic.

McKのアバター

So I tried to.

Nealのアバター

Stay optimistic.

McKのアバター

I see, I see. But I don't think... I don't think I am more optimistic. I see. Only not change.

Nealのアバター

Yes. No difference. Yeah, yeah. I try to be optimistic. Yeah. Is this correct? Yeah, that makes sense.

McKのアバター

How about you? I think I have waves. Some years I'm more optimistic than others. Some years I'm more pessimistic than others. It depends on the year. How about this year? This.

Nealのアバター

Year, I'd say not especially optimistic, not especially pessimistic, just stress-free and normal. I see.

McKのアバター

I see. So, yeah. Okay, so far, do you have any feedback or review my lesson? I think you did really good answering all the questions. If there was feedback, I stopped you.

Nealのアバター

You know, so I don't have any feedback right now, but. I think you did good answering questions and you had good long sentences not just short ones yous know? Thank you. Do you have any feedback for yourself? No but yeah I speak the same I.

McKのアバター

Think I speak same grammar same.

Nealのアバター

Vocabulary so I wanna. I wanna expand it. Expand. Yeah, expand my grammar and vocabulary like that.

McKのアバター

Yo. Yes.

Nealのアバター

I. I don't really feel that way. I think you use quite a bit. I don't know why you feel that way.

McKのアバター

Yeah, of course. I'm not.

Nealのアバター

Native. So, yeah.

McKのアバター

You feel. Of course you feel. I am not native, right? Well, yeah, so more so than expanding vocabulary. I think it's from pronunciation and sometimes speaking slowly, you know, but.

Nealのアバター

When you speak you have good variations so I think that's good. Not enough? Not enough? Well yeah it's good to always want to improve yeah for sure right? For sure but I think you'd be.

McKのアバター

Good no no no no yes yes yeah no no you think yeah of course this is not perfect right? Well, yeah, I mean you can always improve. Yeah, so I need to improve my English, right? But I think your English will improve by listening and speaking and practicing new.

Nealのアバター

Phrases that you find. For example, like take what she said with a grain of salt. You learned that today from Jennifer. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Trying to use those new phrases in your daily conversation.

McKのアバター

I think it will help. But already I think you do good. Honestly, I think for you, instead of changing something, you just need to.

Nealのアバター

Continue your routine. And recently you you have not been continuing your routine, right? Your vocabulary. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So maybe if you continue or change it, you know, change it, like, so it's easier for you to continue it.

McKのアバター

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Nealのアバター

Yeah.

McKのアバター

I try to change. Yeah. More to more effective. Yeah. For me, so, yeah. So I will stop. I stopped my routine, for example, vocabulary like that. So it's easier for you to.

Nealのアバター

No, not easy, but more effective for me. I see. Yeah, it's. I think.

McKのアバター

I don't.

Nealのアバター

I don't mean to.

McKのアバター

I don't mean to. Yeah, I don't. I tried. Now I tried to. Do more effective. Before that, I think I am, I, my goal is doing, my goal was doing routine, not for speaking or memorize the vocabulary only do it. Yeah, it's the. It's not the goal, right? My goal is speaking English more friendly. But recently I feel only doing something is goal.

Nealのアバター

So I want. I will. I want to change that habit. So. So I try to be more effective. So I change your routine so it's more aligned with your goal. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

McKのアバター

That makes sense. So, yeah, it's not.

Nealのアバター

It's not easy, I think. Yeah, yeah, but, yeah. To change or to. To continue, what do you mean? To change and to doing routine. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like that. I think you have days where you don't want to do it and stuff like that. Yeah, yeah, I want to change the routine for my English, improving it. Yeah, English, yeah. I think so. Yeah. I think it's a good idea. I think many people don't try to change and they just quit. That's a good approach that you took. Yeah, yeah.

Nealのアバター

But I think it's important to continue to learn vocabulary. Yeah, but yeah, yeah, it depends on me. Which way is better to me? For me? Yeah, just only learn vocabulary or say something or listening English or reading book or something. It depends on the person, I think. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So I try. I. I need to try everything. Which is better to me? It is better for me.

McKのアバター

You need to try everything to see which is better. Which is better?

Nealのアバター

Yeah, yeah, yeah. So now I try to something different. How is it going? I don't know.

McKのアバター

Too soon to tell. Continue.

Nealのアバター

What do you mean to change to doing routine? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like that, I think.

McKのアバター

Do you have days where you don't want to do it and stuff like that?

Nealのアバター

Yeah, yeah. I want to change the routine for my English. Improving. Yeah. English? Yeah, I think so.

McKのアバター

Be a good year for your English and even better than last year.
