Okay, let's take a look. So my name is Alma. It's a pleasure. What is your name and where are you from?

Nealのアバター
Now, I'm from Japan and my name is Minoru and my nickname is Niu, so please call me Niu.

Alma Gのアバター
Neal.

Nealのアバター
I live in Tokyo now and I have a girlfriend. She's American and we talk about, we talk, we speak usually in Japanese, but I want to improve my English, so sometimes we speak in English and,

Nealのアバター
yeah, like that. And I'm a software engineer and, yeah, like that. Mm

Alma Gのアバター
Okay, I understand,

Nealのアバター
-hmm,

Alma Gのアバター
Neal.

Nealのアバター
yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
And so is this the relationship, the main

Nealのアバター
mm

Alma Gのアバター
reason why

Nealのアバター
-hmm.

Alma Gのアバター
you're here on Cambly?

Nealのアバター
Yeah, but before we, we've been dating for one and a half years

Alma Gのアバター
Okay.

Nealのアバター
for now, but before we met, I am curious about, I was curious about, uh, I've been curious about English and I, I used Cambly, uh, not very often, but, uh, last August, 2025, in August, we went to the United States to

Alma Gのアバター
Okay.

Nealのアバター
visit her hometown. She's from

Alma Gのアバター
Oh, that's

Nealのアバター
Idaho.

Alma Gのアバター
nice.

Nealのアバター
Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's from Idaho and it was my first time traveling abroad and it was very exciting and it was a milestone for me in my life, so it made me want to study English. So, I studied Cambly and, uh, maybe, so I've been, uh, studying English for,

Nealのアバター
for, for months, like that, yeah. So, I studied Cambly, yeah.

Alma Gのアバター
You retook your English journey since that trip to Idaho?

Nealのアバター
Yeah, yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
Okay.

Nealのアバター
yeah, yeah, exactly, yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
That's

Nealのアバター
yeah, yeah.

Alma Gのアバター
awesome. Okay. That's amazing. Was that your first time abroad ever or was it the first time specifically in the U .S.?

Nealのアバター
No, uh, the, the, uh, it was my first time traveling, uh, traveling abroad, yeah.

Alma Gのアバター
Okay.

Nealのアバター
Oh,

Alma Gのアバター
Ever.

Nealのアバター
yeah, yeah, yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
Okay.

Nealのアバター
not ever, ever, yeah.

Alma Gのアバター
Okay. Okay. That's amazing. So after that trip and that it kind of like opened your mind,

Nealのアバター
Exactly,

Alma Gのアバター
what are your plans for the future? Like have you considered living abroad or maybe working abroad because you said you're a software engineer?

Nealのアバター
yeah, yeah, I'm a software engineer, so, yeah, so, I, I, ideally, uh, I, uh, I want to go to abroad and back on first, and sometimes we, I stay Japan and, and, and sometimes we want, I want to, uh, stay somewhere else for two or three months and back, and back to America, uh, Japan,

Alma Gのアバター
Okay.

Nealのアバター
I stay, uh, yeah, yeah, like that. So, I want to, uh, I want to work anywhere, uh, some, uh, in the future, yeah, it's my ideal plan, so, yeah. So,

Alma Gのアバター
Okay.

Nealのアバター
I want, I, it, for me, uh, I, I need English, you know, only for daily life, but also for work, yeah, yeah, I think

Alma Gのアバター
Okay.

Nealのアバター
so, yeah, yeah, yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
I understand. So your work requires you to work from distance or from long distance like you don't have to attend to any office?

Nealのアバター
yeah, yeah, yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
Okay.

Nealのアバター
yeah, yes, now I work from home, uh, yeah, yeah, exactly, yeah, like

Alma Gのアバター
A hundred

Nealのアバター
that,

Alma Gのアバター
percent.

Nealのアバター
yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
That's amazing. It sounded though as if you were interested in traveling

Nealのアバター
yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
more. However, it seems like you're not thinking about living abroad permanently. Like

Nealのアバター
yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
you would like

Nealのアバター
yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
to

Nealのアバター
yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
return to your

Nealのアバター
yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
hometown, right?

Nealのアバター
yeah, yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
Okay.

Nealのアバター
I love Japan, yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
Okay.

Nealのアバター
so, maybe it's, and my girlfriend loves Japan, too,

Alma Gのアバター
Oh,

Nealのアバター
so,

Alma Gのアバター
keep

Nealのアバター
maybe a bit, I think our placement is Japan, and, and sometimes I want to, we want to go somewhere and stay for a month, and back to Japan, and back

Alma Gのアバター
going.

Nealのアバター
and forth, and yeah, yeah, yeah, like that,

Alma Gのアバター
I

Nealのアバター
yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
understand. I mean, it

Nealのアバター
yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
makes

Nealのアバター
yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
sense. I think the quality of life is way higher compared

Nealのアバター
yeah, yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
to any other country probably. Right.

Nealのアバター
exactly,

Alma Gのアバター
Okay.

Nealのアバター
yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
Okay.

Nealのアバター
yeah, yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
That's amazing.

Nealのアバター
yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
So your girlfriend loves Japan as well. That's

Nealのアバター
yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
a

Nealのアバター
exactly,

Alma Gのアバター
plus

Nealのアバター
yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
then.

Nealのアバター
sure,

Alma Gのアバター
Yeah. Okay.

Nealのアバター
yeah, yeah, yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
I see, Neil. And then I wanted to ask you, what would you like to practice for today? Do you usually like to do like a specific type of lessons for conversation? What do you like to do?

Nealのアバター

Nealのアバター
but, yeah, so, at this time, we, we want to know each other, yeah, but I, I sometimes use, uh, the Engoo, uh, Engoo articles, or later,

Alma Gのアバター
Okay.

Nealのアバター
yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
You

Nealのアバター
yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
like to

Nealのアバター
yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
use that too. Okay.

Nealのアバター
yeah, uh,

Alma Gのアバター

Alma Gのアバター
I mean, my city is my

Nealのアバター
Mm -hmm.

Alma Gのアバター
city in the in the center. Like we're surrounded by by hills and mountains. So my city is it was it sucked coming back from the beach because the beach had like a very incredible temperature. They had like they were like at twenty five degrees,

Nealのアバター
Oh,

Alma Gのアバター
which

Nealのアバター
yeah, yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
is

Alma Gのアバター
optimal.

I feel like that's just like the perfect weather.

Nealのアバター
yeah.

Alma Gのアバター
Don't you like it's

Nealのアバター
Yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
like

Nealのアバター
yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
very pleasant. Yeah. But coming back to my city, we were at four degrees. So huge

Nealのアバター
yeah.

Alma Gのアバター
gap. Yeah. Big contrast. Yeah. But it was it was fun while it lasted. Yes. Yes. Yeah. That's that's what we did over here. The beach. The beach. Is does it how cold does it get? Because you said it's not known like Tokyo is not known for for skiing. But how cold does it get for you guys?

Nealのアバター
Maybe around 7 or 8 degrees on

Alma Gのアバター
OK.

Nealのアバター
average, yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
On

Nealのアバター
so it's

Alma Gのアバター
average.

Nealのアバター
cold and

Alma Gのアバター
Yeah,

Nealのアバター
yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
it is.

Nealのアバター
exactly,

Alma Gのアバター
It's bearable, but it's still chilly like you don't want to wake up in the morning and leave your bed.

Nealのアバター
exactly, yeah. Yeah,

Alma Gのアバター
Yeah. Yeah,

Nealのアバター
yeah, yeah,

Alma Gのアバター

Alma Gのアバター
to leave your bed in the morning with

Nealのアバター

Alma Gのアバター
those temperatures. Do you guys have like a like a staple winter drink? You know how

Nealのアバター
