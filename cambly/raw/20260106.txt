Nealのアバター
Mm -hmm. Oh,

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
Well,

Nealのアバター
really?

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
yeah, what what

Nealのアバター
Oh

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
I know about languages is they're not you cannot learn a language from a book The only thing you can learn from a book is grammar. That's it and You certainly can't learn from an application on your phone Language is learned only by listening Okay So you you have to be exposed to listening to English often at least

Nealのアバター
I

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
one hour a day All right

Nealのアバター
see. Yeah

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
It doesn't matter what you're listening to it could be a podcast an audio book you do but movie a TV series But make it a point to listen to English one hour a day. Very

Nealのアバター
Yeah,

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
important. Okay

Nealのアバター
I see I see so I I have a question, uh how How focus on the listening? Uh

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
No

Nealのアバター
during our during the hour

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
Good good question

Nealのアバター
Yeah

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
You see the way the brain works with languages and I know something about this. I researched this for six years The subconscious mind and the conscious mind the conscious mind and the subconscious mind The subconscious mind you you have no control over but it is always learning. It's always

Nealのアバター
Yeah,

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
me okay,

Nealのアバター
yeah,

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
and

Nealのアバター
yeah, okay

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
The fact is you say how do I focus on learning vocabulary? Well, you don't have to focus That's the beauty of it. All you have to do is hear You know Let me give you an example,

Nealのアバター
Yeah

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
I worked I worked in Turkey for six years All right, and I spoke English at my workplace in Turkey. I had no interest in their language It was not it was not useful for

Nealのアバター
Yeah,

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
me to learn

Nealのアバター
yeah,

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
a language

Nealのアバター
yeah

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
But after six years of hearing Turkish Turkish Turkish Turkish everywhere Turkish. I Learned to speak Turkish not very well, but you have to keep in mind. I wasn't even trying to learn. Okay,

Nealのアバター
Oh

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
so Imagine how powerful Listening to

Nealのアバター
Yeah,

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
a language. I learned the language when I wasn't even trying to learn it, but you are trying to improve it

Nealのアバター
yeah, yeah, yeah,

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
So the thing is you don't have to focus on anything. You just have to listen. That's

Nealのアバター
uh,

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
it

Nealのアバター
I

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
Okay

Nealのアバター
see yeah, yeah, you got it

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
No, yeah, and That works because The subconscious mind works harder than your car and you know, the reason it works harder is because The conscious mind is busy doing one thousand other things at the same time, right? It's giving instructions to breathe to move your hands to walk to it to see to hear The conscious mind is very busy mind the subconscious mind yeah, it has nothing to do so it's been a lot of time Trying to figure out For example, what does rectify me?

Nealのアバター
What

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
Do you know?

Nealのアバター
what word

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
rectify

Nealのアバター
like if I don't know the word

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
Wow You you don't know this word rectify your subconscious mind just heard this word now for the

Nealのアバター
Yeah,

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
first time

Nealのアバター
yeah, yeah

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
Yeah, and so did your conscious mind, okay rectify rectify now

Nealのアバター
Yeah,

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
the way the brain works Which subconscious mind is gonna forget about this word. You know why? Because it's not very important. There's more important

Nealのアバター
yeah,

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
to do like

Nealのアバター
yeah,

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
Breathing.

Nealのアバター
okay

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
Okay. All right. You see your subconscious mind It has nothing to do. It's now really pissed off because it doesn't know what rectify is means Over the next few days your subconscious mind

Nealのアバター
Yeah

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
is gonna try very hard to figure out. What does rectify mean? you know I Will tell you what it means now, but even if I don't tell you what it means Trust me in about one week or two weeks your subconscious mind will figure it out Okay,

Nealのアバター
Mm -hmm. Yeah

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
it means correct to correct something So if you wrote a code that is not executing properly, I Might say to you. I want you to rectify this problem Okay, in other words it means I want you to correct this problem All right Also, I don't know if you've tried this before but it doesn't work Trying to memorize words Okay, when you silently in

Nealのアバター
I

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
your mind try to memorize words like supersede What does supersede mean?

Nealのアバター
don't know

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
supersede so I'm gonna tell you now I Am going to I'm going to vocally tell you that means I'm using my voice to tell you supersede means That everything that came before does not count only what I do now counts That means superseding something right So everything before does not count only from this point on does something count that's superseding Now Neil if you read this word

Nealのアバター
Yep

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
silent in your mind You will you will have for you would forget this word in three days, okay? Because the memory does not work very good with the eyes

Nealのアバター
Yep,

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
Okay,

Nealのアバター
yep

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
but hearing is very strong in your memory, so Trust me if you and I speak again in one week

Nealのアバター
Yep

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
and I ask you Neil What does supersede means you will remember supersede means nothing before counts only what we do now counts Okay Yeah

Nealのアバター
I see

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
All

Nealのアバター
I see

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
right. In other words what I'm telling you is When you're studying English do it out loud

Nealのアバター
Uh, uh -huh, uh,

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
No, you don't understand me. I can tell by your body language. I've lost you about two minutes ago, okay?

Nealのアバター
okay. Okay. Okay

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
All right, let me rephrase

Nealのアバター
Mm

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
it everything you do related to learning English

Nealのアバター
-hmm

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
Speak it if you don't speak it you will

Nealのアバター

-hmm.

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
All right

Nealのアバター
Mm

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
Yeah,

Nealのアバター
-hmm

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
because the brain memory works well What it hears?

Nealのアバター
Uh, I

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
It does

Nealのアバター
see

Dragan Daniel Vujicのアバター
not work. Well what it sees okay? Let me give you an example

Nealのアバター
