(Tutor) But—  
(Me) Mm-hmm, mm.  
(Tutor) Now—  
(Me) -hmm.  
(Tutor) I'm ready to go back. What part of Tokyo are you in?  
(Me) I mean, not central, like, nearly Tokyo, the Skytree. Do you know the Skytree?  
(Tutor) I only know Shinjuku, that's all I know.  
(Me) The Tokyo... Mm-hmm. Almost—  
(Tutor) Bad.  
(Me) Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, almost near the Shinjuku, yeah.  
(Tutor) That's expensive area.  
(Me) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I like this area, and many places are very expensive, but my area is not so expensive. Relatively another area, so, and, yeah, it's very good. I like my neighborhood, so, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
(Tutor) How did you meet your girlfriend?  
(Me) We met on the dating app, and she's good at speaking Japanese, so.  
(Tutor) Wow.  
(Me) We, yeah, so we speak Japanese, usually, but I went to the United States last August. Yeah, and originally, I've been curious about English before we met, and I went to, it was my first time traveling abroad, and I went to the United States to visit her hometown, and it's in Idaho.  
(Tutor) Idaho.  
(Me) And, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, it was, but then I can't speak, I couldn't speak English very well, so I studied Cambrian after the traveling, and, yeah, now I want to improve my English more. It's my motivation, yeah.  
(Tutor) I have never been to Idaho. What is it like in this state?  
(Me) Of course, I don't know another state, but I like Idaho, because there are a lot of natures, and people are very kind.  
(Tutor) Yeah, I imagine.  
(Me) Yeah, yeah.  
(Tutor) People are very kind.  
(Me) And—  
(Tutor) And everybody eats potatoes.  
(Me) Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, and she often said that, you know, United States are very dangerous, and especially the city, New York is very high, very expensive, especially this term. So, I was very, I was a little bit nervous, but, yeah, it's a very good opportunity to visit her hometown, yeah.  
(Tutor) Because the yen is very low now, right?  
(Me) Exactly, exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
(Tutor) So how long—  
(Me) It's very—  
(Tutor) Have—  
(Me) Weird.

(Me) Yeah. Yeah.

(Me) Do you like Saitama? Do you like Punch Man?  
(Tutor) Yeah, I love Saitama. Actually—  
(Me) Yeah, me too.  
(Tutor) I only saw the first season. I haven't seen second or third season, Genos—  
(Me) It's very, yeah, yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I like you, because you are very funny, and, yeah, so, yeah. Yeah, I wish you have a good luck with summer, with my summer, yeah.  
(Tutor) Thank you, but it's never going to happen. Now does she teach English in Japan?  
(Me) She used to. Yeah, but now she's working as an engineer.  
(Tutor) Wow.  
(Me) A software engineer. And I'm a software engineer, too. And, yeah, she changed jobs last September. Before that, she works for a company in Japan. And, yeah, she wanted to change jobs, so I recommend a software engineer. And I, and she, she was, she was curious about engineers, so I recommend it. And she changed jobs. She become an engineer, yeah.  
(Tutor) Is it easy for an American to find a job like that in—  
(Me) No.  
(Tutor) Japan?  
(Me) It's very difficult. So, she looks very, she looked very hard, but she wanted to become an—  
(Tutor) Well—  
(Me) Engineer, yeah, and—  
(Tutor) She's—  
(Me) Get—  
(Tutor) Probably—  
(Me) A job.  
(Tutor) She sounds very talented, very smart.  
(Me) Yeah, yeah, she's very smart. And I don't know how to say it in English, but she's very... She's very attempt to...  
(Tutor) She's very self-motivated, maybe she's—  
(Me) So, yeah, yeah, yeah, like that, yeah.  
(Tutor) Very determined.  
(Me) Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
(Tutor) Wow.  
(Me) Like that.  
(Tutor) You're a lucky man.  
(Me) Yeah, I'm lucky, man.  
(Tutor) My ex-girlfriend was the laziest woman. Yeah. That was about ten years ago. She was lazy. No ambition. No ambition.  
(Me) Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
(Tutor) I know it's very— It's—  
(Me) Maybe.  
(Tutor) Early, but maybe do you think you will marry her?  
(Me) But I don't think software, but... Some, no, I don't know. We don't rush, so... Yeah, software, maybe, yeah.  
(Tutor) You mentioned you and your girlfriend are software engineers. So, what do you think about AI? Will it affect your industry?  
(Me) Yeah. Of course, I use AI for job or work. And last year, just start of the last year, 2025, January, I thought AI is not still useful. But the end of this, end of the 2025, I was amazed how smart they are. So, I'm very surprised and I'm a little bit nervous about AI. So, I focus on studying AI recently. And, yeah, it's very smart and it's very game changer, I think. Yeah.  
(Tutor) Are—  
(Me) Especially...  
(Tutor) You worried about your job, some people—  
(Me) Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe the engineers still need for many companies, but... I have to be... I have to use AI more effectively, more effective. Yeah, I think so. So, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's very... Yeah.  
(Tutor) So my friend is, he was a coder. He doesn't do it anymore because AI took his job, but—  
(Me) Exactly.  
(Tutor) Now he works in cybersecurity. And he has a better job now. Yeah.  
(Me) Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think so. Just code, it takes place to AI. So, we need, the engineers need to more, another... Need to supply another value. Yeah, yeah.  
(Tutor) Need to supplement their knowledge maybe.  
(Me) Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
(Tutor) Or need to learn more.  
(Me) Yeah, yeah, exactly.  
(Tutor) So—  
(Me) Like that. Yeah.  
(Tutor) How do you always study in your business, your industry?  
(Me) Yeah, yeah. I was, I constantly studying my area, my... I constantly study technology. Like, yeah, what the new topics or new information like that. Yeah.  
(Tutor) So it's never-ending. You always have to study.  
(Me) Maybe. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I like my job, so it's not the bad thing. But, yeah, yeah. But AI is very... It's very, yeah, game changer, I think. So, yeah.  
(Tutor) Which AI tools do you use?  
(Me) I, for the daily chore, daily using is ChatGPT. But when I write the code, the programming, I use fraud code, fraud. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.  
(Tutor) What do you think about, I don't know if you use this, DeepSeek.  
(Me) Deep, deep. Deep? Ah, maybe deep research?  
(Tutor) Deep—  
(Me) No?  
(Tutor) Seek is China, China's—  
(Me) I don't use this.  
(Tutor) I think for language translation DeepSeek is very good with my experience.  
(Me) Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
(Tutor) I'm—  
(Me) Maybe.  
(Tutor) Studying Thai language and the translations are really good.  
(Me) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Especially the language is... The ChatGPT, Gemini or like that, something like that. It's very, very good, recently. Not so different the house—  
(Tutor) All right.  
(Me) Model. Yeah, yeah.  
(Tutor) Not—  
(Me) Yeah. They—  
(Tutor) Much—  
(Me) Are very—  
(Tutor) Difference.  
(Me) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think so, yeah.  
(Tutor) What do you think about the future of Japan? Because I—  
(Me) Mm-hmm.  
(Tutor) Know the birth rate is very low.  
(Me) -hmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, maybe it's the problem that population is decreasing. But, so we need to accept the voters worker.  
(Tutor) You think so? Yeah.  
(Me) Yeah, yeah, I think so. So, yeah, I think the Japanese workforce is getting weaker, I think.  
(Tutor) No—  
(Me) Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, the data... The... The convenience store had employees and they are almost Chinese or Korean. And, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, there are a few stores in which aware Japanese people work there.  
(Tutor) So you have a negative outlook for—  
(Me) Yeah, yeah.  
(Tutor) The future.  
(Me) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think it's... Getting weaker relative to other countries. Yeah, I think. Mm-hmm.  
(Tutor) Well, is that the reason why people are not having children, because—  
(Me) Yeah, it's...  
(Tutor) Economy.  
(Me) Yeah, yeah, yeah. The price is very high, but our salary is not... Not raised. It doesn't raise. So.  
(Tutor) It doesn't raise.  
(Me) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, and about the... When it comes to AI, AI companies are almost Chinese or American, not Japan. We don't—  
(Tutor) Why—  
(Me) Have—  
(Tutor) Though?  
(Me) It—  
(Tutor) Why? I don't understand.  
(Me) It's... Yeah, they... We, in Japan, we don't have the power to develop the AI now. But the government said recently that they built a project to develop the Japanese AI. Yeah, so, yeah. They wanted to keep up with AI, but maybe for now, we can't keep up with the speed of AI now. Yeah.  
(Tutor) But I'm sure Japan has some amazing—  
(Me) Mm-hmm.  
(Tutor) Engineers that are working on this.  
(Me) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, yeah. But another... The product... We don't have... Many... We don't have many... We don't have big company.  
(Tutor) Like Nvidia or something like that.  
(Me) Yeah, like that. Yeah, like that. Yeah, Google or like that. So, yeah. It's... Yeah. Relatively, we don't... We can't keep up with the economy from the companies or countries.  
(Tutor) Do—  
(Me) Yeah, yeah.  
(Tutor) You want children in the future?  
(Me) Yeah, it's...  
(Tutor) It's a big question, sorry.  
(Me) Yeah. No, no, no, no, no. It's 50-50 for now. I want—  
(Tutor) It's—  
(Me) Children.  
(Tutor) 50—  
(Me) But—  
(Tutor) 50, or I am on the fence about it. On—  
(Me) I'm—  
(Tutor) On the fence means—  
(Me) On the—  
(Tutor) 50—  
(Me) Fence.  
(Tutor) 50.  
(Me) Yeah, I'm on the fence about it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. How about you?  
(Tutor) Oh, no.  
(Me) You...  
(Tutor) No.  
(Me) Really?  
(Tutor) Children, no. In the past, yes, but now I'm 48 years old. Not now. Oh—  
(Me) I—  
(Tutor) God.  
(Me) See.  
(Tutor) No. Every day I'm thinking about retirement.  
(Me) Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

(Me) -hmm.  
(Tutor) Many people.  
(Me) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
(Tutor) I can't go outside. It's too many—  
(Me) -hmm.  
(Tutor) Tourists.  
(Me) Too many people.  
(Tutor) Too many, like Japan. We have over-tourism.  
(Me) Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a problem that... Like, Kyoto is very... So many foreigners, so many tourists. Yeah, it's the social problem, the new—  
(Tutor) Because—  
(Me) Set.  
(Tutor) A lot of tourists are disrespectful—  
(Me) Yeah, exactly.

(Me) Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
(Tutor) So I agree with her.  
(Me) Yeah, it's sad. Yeah, but Japan, before I said that Japan needs more workers, so we have to accept the foreigners to work. So, yeah, it's... Yeah, I don't know, but it's a tough situation. And she... Someday, the prime minister has to accept the foreigners, maybe.

## Highlights (Evidence-based)

- New Year & life situation exchange  
  - Me: “I'm from Japan, and I live in Tokyo, and I have a girlfriend. She's American. We live together now.”  
  - Tutor: talking about Brooklyn, New York, being cold, expensive, and dangerous, and feeling miserable after returning from Asia.

- First trip abroad & Idaho impression  
  - Me: “It was my first time traveling abroad, and I went to the United States to visit her hometown, and it's in Idaho… there are a lot of natures, and people are very kind.”

- Motivation for English & AI  
  - Me: “I can't speak, I couldn't speak English very well, so I studied Cambrian after the traveling, and, yeah, now I want to improve my English more. It's my motivation.”  
  - Later: “I was amazed how smart they are. So, I'm very surprised and I'm a little bit nervous about AI… it's very game changer, I think.”

- Girlfriend’s career change to software engineer  
  - Me: “She used to [teach English]. Yeah, but now she's working as an engineer… she changed jobs last September… she was curious about engineers, so I recommend it. And she changed jobs. She become an engineer, yeah.”

## My Issues (Evidence-based)

- Recurring issues Top 5:

  1. **Article / plural mistakes with abstract nouns and countries**  
     - Evidence quote: “there are a lot of natures” / “United States are very dangerous”  
     - Why it matters: Articles and plural forms strongly affect naturalness and clarity.

  2. **Awkward or incorrect word choice**  
     - Evidence quote: “I studied Cambrian after the traveling” / “we need to accept the voters worker” / “Just code, it takes place to AI.”  
     - Why it matters: Wrong word choice can confuse listeners and hide your real meaning.

  3. **Tense consistency problems**  
     - Evidence quote: “then I can't speak, I couldn't speak English very well” / “she become an engineer” / “our salary is not... Not raised. It doesn't raise.”  
     - Why it matters: Clear tense helps listeners follow time order and understand whether something is past, present, or future.

  4. **Unclear or incomplete comparative expressions**  
     - Evidence quote: “my area is not so expensive. Relatively another area” / “It's... Getting weaker relative to other countries.”  
     - Why it matters: Comparisons are common in discussion; incomplete forms sound unnatural and can be confusing.

  5. **Difficulty expressing nuance about AI / economy**  
     - Evidence quote: “we need, the engineers need to more, another... Need to supply another value” / “we don't have the power to develop the AI now”  
     - Why it matters: For professional topics, precise language is important to sound competent and confident.

## Repair (Minimal)

- “Better ways to say it” (6 items)

1.  
  - Original: “there are a lot of natures”  
  - Natural (American English): “there is a lot of nature” / “there’s so much nature”  
  - Quick note: “Nature” is usually uncountable in this meaning.

2.
