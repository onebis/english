You're supposed to get six right. Yes, you pass. You're better better than I thought. Okay. Good. All right. So do you watch English television series and movies.

**(Me)** I like.

**(Tutor)** Yes. Okay. All right. Look, language, and I speak several language. I speak five languages.

**(Me)** Mm-hmm. Oh.

**(Tutor)** Well.

**(Me)** Really?

**(Tutor)** Yeah, what what I know about languages is they're not you cannot learn a language from a book. The only thing you can learn from a book is grammar, that's it. And you certainly can't learn from an application on your phone. Language is learned only by listening. Okay. So you you have to be exposed to listening to English often at least.

**(Me)** I.

**(Tutor)** One hour a day. All right.

**(Me)** See. Yeah.

**(Tutor)** It doesn't matter what you're listening to. It could be a podcast, an audio book you do, but movie, a TV series. But make it a point to listen to English one hour a day. Very important. Okay.

**(Me)** I see I see so I I have a question, uh how how focus on the listening? Uh.

**(Tutor)** No.

**(Me)** During our during the hour.

**(Tutor)** Good good question. You see the way the brain works with languages and I know something about this. I researched this for six years. The subconscious mind and the conscious mind, the conscious mind and the subconscious mind. The subconscious mind you you have no control over but it is always learning. It's always me, okay, and.

**(Me)** Yeah, okay.

**(Tutor)** The fact is you say how do I focus on learning vocabulary? Well, you don't have to focus. That's the beauty of it. All you have to do is hear, you know. Let me give you an example, I worked I worked in Turkey for six years. All right, and I spoke English at my workplace in Turkey. I had no interest in their language. It was not it was not useful for me to learn a language. But after six years of hearing Turkish Turkish Turkish Turkish everywhere Turkish. I learned to speak Turkish, not very well, but you have to keep in mind I wasn't even trying to learn. Okay, so imagine how powerful listening to a language. I learned the language when I wasn't even trying to learn it, but you are trying to improve it.

**(Me)** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**(Tutor)** So the thing is you don't have to focus on anything. You just have to listen. That's.

**(Me)** Uh.

**(Tutor)** It.

**(Me)** I see yeah, yeah, you got it.

**(Tutor)** No, yeah, and that works because the subconscious mind works harder than your car and you know, the reason it works harder is because the conscious mind is busy doing one thousand other things at the same time, right? It's giving instructions to breathe, to move your hands, to walk, to to see, to hear. The conscious mind is very busy mind. The subconscious mind yeah, it has nothing to do so it spend a lot of time trying to figure out for example, what does rectify me.

**(Me)** What.

**(Tutor)** Do you know?

**(Me)** What word.

**(Tutor)** Rectify.

**(Me)** Like if I don't know the word.

**(Tutor)** Wow. You you don't know this word rectify. Your subconscious mind just heard this word now for the first time.

**(Me)** Yeah, yeah.

**(Tutor)** Yeah, and so did your conscious mind, okay. Rectify, rectify. Now the way the brain works which subconscious mind is gonna forget about this word. You know why? Because it's not very important. There's more important to do like breathing. Okay. All right. You see your subconscious mind it has nothing to do. It's now really pissed off because it doesn't know what rectify is means. Over the next few days your subconscious mind is gonna try very hard to figure out what does rectify mean, you know. I will tell you what it means now, but even if I don't tell you what it means, trust me in about one week or two weeks your subconscious mind will figure it out. Okay.

**(Me)** Mm-hmm. Yeah.

**(Tutor)** It means correct, to correct something. So if you wrote a code that is not executing properly, I might say to you, I want you to rectify this problem. Okay, in other words it means I want you to correct this problem. All right. Also, I don't know if you've tried this before but it doesn't work trying to memorize words. Okay, when you silently in.

**(Me)** I.

**(Tutor)** Your mind try to memorize words like supersede. What does supersede mean?

**(Me)** Don't know.

**(Tutor)** Supersede. So I'm gonna tell you now. I am going to I'm going to vocally tell you, that means I'm using my voice to tell you supersede means that everything that came before does not count, only what I do now counts. That means superseding something, right. So everything before does not count only from this point on does something count, that's superseding. Now [Neal] if you read this word silent in your mind, you will you will have for you would forget this word in three days, okay? Because the memory does not work very good with the eyes. Okay, but hearing is very strong in your memory, so trust me if you and I speak again in one week and I ask you [Neal] what does supersede means you will remember supersede means nothing before counts only what we do now counts. Okay. Yeah. All right. In other words what I'm telling you is when you're studying English do it out loud.

**(Me)** Uh, uh-huh, uh.

**(Tutor)** No, you don't understand me. I can tell by your body language. I've lost you about two minutes ago, okay?

**(Me)** Okay. Okay. Okay.

**(Tutor)** All right, let me rephrase it. Everything you do related to learning English.

**(Me)** -hmm.

**(Tutor)** Speak it. If you don't speak it you will forget.

**(Me)** -hmm.

**(Tutor)** It, okay.

**(Me)** Uh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay.

**(Tutor)** All right. Yeah.

**(Me)** -hmm.

**(Tutor)** Because the brain memory works well what it hears.

**(Me)** Uh, I.

**(Tutor)** It does.

**(Me)** See.

**(Tutor)** Not work well what it sees, okay? Let me give you an example. You've known your girlfriend for one and a half years now, right? Okay, and you met her parents, right? Okay.

**(Me)** Yes, yes.

**(Tutor)** I'm I'm sure her father or her mother must have told you a story something something. Okay, it doesn't matter what, it doesn't matter what it is, and it's.

**(Me)** -hmm.

**(Tutor)** In your memory now, okay? Because they spoke it. In ten years from now if you never see these people again. You don't see these people in ten years. You don't see them. You will still remember the story they told you.

**(Me)** -hmm.

**(Tutor)** Right? But if I ask you can you describe your girlfriend's father. Trust me. You will not remember what he looks like, okay, in here in ten years. Remember what it looks like, okay, is because the eyes do not remember very well. The ear remember everything. Okay. Yeah. So you got that. Good. What movie did you watch recently that was good in.

**(Me)** Uh in English.

**(Tutor)** English?

**(Me)** Uh we watch the we will watch the Dragon Tales.

**(Tutor)** What.

**(Me)** For Dragon Tales.

**(Tutor)** What.

**(Me)** The.

**(Tutor)** Is dragon is?

**(Me)** The animation for kids, American kids. Yeah the easy.

**(Tutor)** Animation.

**(Me)** Yeah animation. Yeah, yeah the easy English. They speak easy English and and yeah, yeah, so I I I can a little bit. I can understand what they say a little bit. Yeah.

**(Tutor)** All right, okay, I get it. All right, let me let me let me give you some feedback on your English, okay.

**(Me)** Yeah, okay, please.

**(Tutor)** Yes, and I'm gonna write this down for you. Okay here we go. Oh come on. What's going on here? There we go. So I break English down or I in fact I break any language down in five categories, right, and in each category, I'm going to give you a score of one to a hundred. I'm sorry 1–20. 20 20 20. Five categories times 20 is a hundred that's the perfect score or.

**(Me)** Okay, okay, okay.

**(Tutor)** You can get one point for each category. That's five. That's terrible, that means your English is awful. All right, so first category is pronunciation, okay.

**(Me)** Yeah, yeah.

**(Tutor)** Very important category. I give you seven out of a.

**(Me)** Thank.

**(Tutor)** 20.

**(Me)** You.

**(Tutor)** Out of 20, okay? So that means you need to work on pronunciation. All right.

**(Me)** Yeah, okay.

**(Tutor)** Okay, all right. Second category is confidence. Do you know what confidence means?

**(Me)** Uh, yeah, I know this word.

**(Tutor)** Yeah, okay.

**(Me)** But I yeah.

**(Tutor)** Okay, it means how comfortable you are to do something, right? Yeah, and you're amazing man your confidence is almost perfect.

**(Me)** Oh, thank you. Thank.

**(Tutor)** Look.

**(Me)** You.

**(Tutor)** You feel very comfortable to speak English even with complete stranger like me. You just met me.

**(Me)** Thank.

**(Tutor)** And you you're talking to me like you know me for two.

**(Me)** You.

**(Tutor)** Years already. This is good. Yeah.

**(Me)** Thank you, thank you.

**(Tutor)** Alright, so your confidence is really really good. You know almost perfect I would say. Okay. And third place, third most important thing is accent. You know what accent means.

**(Me)** Yeah the like a strength or lower when.

**(Tutor)** Yeah, the.

**(Me)** I.

**(Tutor)** Way you the way you speak like Japanese, right. So your accent is a bit strong, okay? It's.

**(Me)** -hmm.

**(Tutor)** Not that bad but I.

**(Me)** -hmm.

**(Tutor)** Give you and we need just your accent a little bit, okay. And I'll explain how to do that in a moment, okay? Okay. After accent the next most important thing is vocabulary. Obviously we need to know words, right? And I'm afraid you're a bit weak on your vocabulary, okay, I give you eight for that, okay. Yeah, and after vocabulary is grammar, okay, and surprisingly your grammar is not so bad. You know.

**(Me)** Thank.

**(Tutor)** It's.

**(Me)** You. Thank you. Yeah.

**(Tutor)** Not it's not great, but it's much better than your vocabulary. Okay. Well.

**(Me)** Thank you.

**(Tutor)** So now you've got 11 there. Now what we do is we calculate this, okay? We go 7 plus.

**(Me)** Mm-hmm.

**(Tutor)** 19 plus 10 plus 8 plus 11. Okay. And remember 70 if you get 70 you have good English. It's good for business. Okay. You got 55. All right, okay. Under 12 needs work, okay, need work. What do you have under 12? Well pronunciation.

**(Me)** First turn yeah.

**(Tutor)** Accent, vocabulary, grammar everything that confidence, okay?

**(Me)** Yeah, I.

**(Tutor)** Now how do we do fluency? You know what fluent means right, fluent? Okay, if.

**(Me)** Know.

**(Tutor)** You if you were ever considered if you're ever wondering how fluent you are well what I do is I calculate, and you should have over 12 to be fluent, over 12. But I calculate pronunciation, okay, plus vocabulary plus grammar, okay, and you get 26 for you, and then you divide that by 3 and your fluency is right here 8.67, okay, so not quite fluent, okay? Well let me also give you this: A1 and A2 are beginners, okay? That's not you. That's not you. B.

**(Me)** Yeah, okay.

**(Tutor)** 1 and B2 is intermediate, okay? B1 and C2 is advanced. Okay, I think you are B1 level.

**(Me)** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I want to be yeah, I want to I want to reach C1 level ultimate with my yeah.

**(Tutor)** You.

**(Me)** It's my.

**(Tutor)** Know.

**(Me)** Ultimate.

**(Tutor)** Something?

**(Me)** Goal.

**(Tutor)** Normally, I would say that's not really that's not really possible. Normally, I say this because you need to be in an English environment in order to achieve that level but.

**(Me)** Well, yeah.

**(Tutor)** You have a girlfriend.

**(Me)** Yeah, yeah.

**(Tutor)** Who is American and if you speak English with her you are in that environment and therefore you could probably achieve C1 level, okay?

**(Me)** Thank you, yeah, thank.

**(Tutor)** Yeah, so but.

**(Me)** You.

**(Tutor)** Before you get to C1 you got to get to B2.

**(Me)** Exactly exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

**(Tutor)** All right. So you know remember the key is you need to listen, okay? That's first.

**(Me)** Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah.

**(Tutor)** Read read out loud three hours a week, okay?

**(Me)** Okay, okay, okay.

**(Tutor)** All right, don't a no more taking breaks from Cambly like six months or one year, okay? And and I I think I I think you can get to B2 in four to five months, okay, and then from B2 to C1. I don't know it could take over a year over one year. All right. But you really don't need C1. C1 is just because you want it. For business and for everyday regular communication with even native speakers B2 is sufficient. It's enough.

**(Me)** Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I see I see. Okay.

**(Tutor)** But you got to get serious man [Neal]. Okay one.

**(Me)** Mm-hmm.

**(Tutor)** Hour listening to English seven hours a week. Three hours reading out loud. No missing.

**(Me)** -hmm.

**(Tutor)** Cambly classes.

**(Me)** Okay, okay, it's very yeah, thank you for this your advice. It's very thanks. Uh, it's very useful to me. Yeah, yeah, very. Yeah. Thank you so much.

**(Tutor)** You're welcome. I I think you can get to B2 very fast. Okay.

**(Me)** Uh, I I do my best. Yeah.

**(Tutor)** I.

**(Me)** Thank.

**(Tutor)** Hope to.

**(Me)** You.

**(Tutor)** See you again. Bye. Bye.

**(Me)** Bye. Bye.

- Vocabulary quiz (7/10 correct, above tutor’s expectation)  
  - Correct: confess, perk, queue, bang, revise, beech, run into  
  - Wrong/unknown: toddler, skirmish/fare, cubicle

- Tutor’s learning strategy advice  
  - “Language is learned only by listening… be exposed to listening to English often at least one hour a day.”

## My Issues (Evidence-based)

- Recurring issues Top 5:

  1. **Articles (“a / an / the”) and countability**
     - Evidence quote: “I'm software engineer.”  
       “She become an engineer too. She become a software engineer, too.”  
       “She studied abroad to Japan… as a exchange student.”
     - Why it matters: Articles are very noticeable errors and affect naturalness and clarity.

  2. **Verb tense and form**
     - Evidence quote: “We see it's good.”  
       “She become an engineer too.”  
       “She is growing up with hearing her his story about Japan.”  
       “She began to build his her career in Japan.”
     - Why it matters: Incorrect tense/form can confuse time and who is doing the action.

  3. **Pronouns and gender agreement**
     - Evidence quote: “She is her grandfather served in the US military…”  
       “She began to build his her career in Japan.”
     - Why it matters: Wrong pronouns make sentences hard to follow and sound less accurate.

  4. **Word choice / vocabulary gaps**
     - Evidence quote: “My sixth sense says a small flower.” (for “toddler”)  
       “We will watch the Dragon Tales.” (for “We watched Dragon Tales.”)  
       “Move your English.” (tutor’s phrase, but shows possible confusion with “improve”)
     - Why it matters: Limited or incorrect vocabulary can block communication or cause misunderstandings.

  5. **Sentence structure and repetition / fillers**
     - Evidence quote: “So we speak in we usually speak in Japanese, but I want to improve my English. So we sometimes we speak in English.”  
       “I began to study I began to use Cambly and restart Cambly so maybe I have been using Cambly for two no four months constantly…”
     - Why it matters: Repetition and broken structure make speech less fluent and harder to follow.

## Repair (Minimal)

- “Better ways to say it” (6 items)

1.  
  - Original: “I'm software engineer.”  
  - Natural (American English): “I'm a software engineer.”  
  - Quick note: Add “a” before singular jobs.

2.

  - Quick note: Remove extra “we” and “in,” simplify structure.

3.  
  - Original: “She changed jobs and she become an engineer too. She become a software engineer, too.”  
  - Natural: “She changed jobs and became an engineer too. She became a software engineer too.”  
  - Quick note: Use past tense “became” for a completed change.

4.  
  - Original: “She is growing up with hearing her his story about Japan so he she was interested in Japan.”  
  - Natural: “She grew up hearing her grandfather’s stories about Japan, so she became interested in Japan.”  
  - Quick note: Past tense “grew up,” and fix pronouns and “story → stories.”

5.  
  - Original: “Technically maybe two or three years, but I didn't do didn't use Cambly not very often.”  
  - Natural: “Technically I've been on Cambly for two or three years, but I didn't use it very often.”  
  - Quick note: Use present perfect for time up to now, and remove double negatives.

6.  
  - Original: “How focus on the listening during the hour.”  
  - Natural: “How should I focus on listening during that hour?”  
  - Quick note: Add “should I” and “on” to form a natural question.
