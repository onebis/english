Elise Jenkins: Fudge it a little bit.

Neal: -hmm.

Elise Jenkins: All right. Now I mentioned about Japan Japan are.

Neal: -hmm.

Elise Jenkins: Pessimistic.

Neal: Yeah yeah.

Elise Jenkins: Realistic What do you think do you think 2026 will be better than 2025.

Neal: I.

Elise Jenkins: For Japan.

Neal: Think ah Japan Japan will be it's difficult But yeah, I think maybe Japan is not, is bad, will be bad more than 2035 because in Japan there are a lot of problems about the number of laborers or decreasing birth rate like that. Yeah, yeah. And now, yeah, it's getting weaker. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a very difficult situation for.

Elise Jenkins: -hmm.

Neal: Many people. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And many, many kind of, many kind of jobs is, many Japanese countries can't come up, can't keep up with another country's industries like AI or cars or, yeah, like that. So, yeah.

Elise Jenkins: It's.

Neal: Yeah. I think Japan's.

Elise Jenkins: Not the 80s anymore.

Neal: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Japan is getting weaker in many kind of fields. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Elise Jenkins: Yeah, I think yeah, they like the economy in Japan is shifting to tourism, right But people don't like that because it's like the over tourism.

Neal: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah.

Elise Jenkins: Yes, it's tricky And I've heard the the over tourism is everywhere now So it's not it's not just Kyoto and Osaka and Tokyo.

Neal: I think so. Yeah.

Elise Jenkins: Not.

Neal: Yeah, yeah.

Elise Jenkins: Even like oh, yeah, it's like Sapporo and Fukuoka. No, it's Everywhere like your hometown.

Neal: Exactly.

Elise Jenkins: In Yamanashi is like why.

Neal: Yeah, yeah.

Elise Jenkins: Are.

Neal: Exactly.

Elise Jenkins: All those these foreigners walking around?

Neal: Exactly.

Elise Jenkins: What is happening?

Neal: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. My hometown can look the Mount Fuji and, yeah, and there is the famous spot where we can see, they see Mount Fuji. It's, there are many tourists from, from another country, the foreigners, stay, they stay in the spot and, and stop the cars. They stay in the roads to take pictures. So, it's very big problem. Yeah.

Elise Jenkins: My my town always had a similar problem in the summer Because we got a lot of tourists during the summer for people who wanted to do water sports or they wanted to go fishing because like I said, we were like a fishing town and my town has one road coming in and one road going out and.

Neal: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Elise Jenkins: The one road coming in is like this little bridge and sometimes it and by the way, the actual town is only about two square miles So at like four square kilometers, it's it's very small square not like the.

Neal: Yeah, yeah.

Elise Jenkins: Process where so The Sometimes it could take you 40 minutes to get across the bridge and through town Because of all the traffic.

Neal: Yeah, yeah.

Elise Jenkins: It's.

Neal: Yeah, yeah.

Elise Jenkins: Such a headache. It's the worst.

Neal: Exactly. Exactly. Yeah.
